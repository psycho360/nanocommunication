Two arduinos communicating through SoftwareSerial for syncing data
This project is useful if you are interested in using multiple sensors via multiple arduino and you want fetch the sensors by syncing both the arduinos.
Right now I am working on wifi connection including this hence, the wifi source code is not uploaded yet. Will add soon.
